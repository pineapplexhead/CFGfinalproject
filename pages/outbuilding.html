        Will Green<br>"What a terrible shame. I only briefly met Charles a few nights ago when he came into the living room when I was reading my book. So, I can’t say I know anything about him. What I can say is he has done a great job with this company. Once this is all sorted out, I will definitely stay here again. It has been an excellent trip!”<br><br>
        Will is a guest at R&R’s B&B, and he has been staying for a week or so now. He is meant to depart this afternoon. He has been spending his days doing all sorts of workshops and going on adventures around the Cotswolds. He says he has no connection to Charles except for having met him once a few nights ago, but then he went straight off on a jewellery making course. He starts telling you fun facts about his trips like – “Did you know that cyanide is used in the process of plating jewellery?” And “Did you know there is only one bird endemic to the UK?”<br><br>
        Yesterday he went off on a cycling trip. He had to borrow a few items from the B&B for his trip, including some bottles of water and rope to help attach his bike to his car. Both of which, Dusty helped him source. He returned this morning, and others at the same campsite as him can vouch for the fact he was not anywhere near the B&B.

        You quickly spot the rifles on the wall. Could one of these have been the murder weapon? All three look very old and have a thin layer of dust on them.
