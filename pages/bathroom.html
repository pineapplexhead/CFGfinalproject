        Dusty Reyes<br>Dusty is the head of housekeeping at R&R’s bed and breakfast. She has two children, Lewis and Hazel, with her ex-husband Walter who is the manager of the B&B. As well as her housekeeping tasks, she is often busy helping guests with requests<br><br>
        “Only yesterday morning, Mr Green was asking me for some rope! I get some very specific requests from our guests. Thankfully I was able to find some for him in the shed.”<br><br>
        Dusty is very chatty, and she tells you lots of irrelevant information. Thankfully, after some time you get her back onto the subject and she tells you…<br>
        “I am ashamed to admit that I broke off my marriage with Walter after I slept with Charles several times. This was over 20 years ago and believe me, I am a different person now. I would never do something like that again and hurt my family. Thankfully, I don’t think Walter ever found out… we may not be together anymore, but I still care for him, and I fear that the affair would have broken his heart for good.”

        Lying around is an old, battered crime novel. You are not sure if anyone is reading it- it may well have been left behind by one of the B&B guests. Flipping through it, the first page catches your eye...<br><br>Click to read
