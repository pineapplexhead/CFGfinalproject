        Marc Jasper<br>Marc is the gardener for R&R’s bed and breakfast. He tells you that he has spent years saying he will quit this place because of the way Charles treated him <br>
        “That old git was always so grumpy with me… but this is one of the only full-time gardening gigs around, and I need the stability to support my little boy. Perhaps it will get better now Charles has gone. I probably shouldn’t say that, but who cares. I obviously had nothing to do with it. He probably just ate and drank too much for his old heart.” <br><br>
        When you talk to him about any suspicious activity, he tells you that he noticed that the rope went missing from the shed the other night but didn’t think too much of it as things often go missing here. <br><br>
        He then tells you that he must crack on, he picks up his shovel, pulls on his jacket, and you notice he has a small badge of a little monkey on his collar, before he walks away.

        You find some grubby rope lying around. Seems like it is out of place here…
