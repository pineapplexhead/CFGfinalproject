        Holly Anderson <br> Holly is the young, enthusiastic receptionist. Earlier this year, she got engaged to her high-school sweetheart, Rob. She chats to you a little but doesn’t seem as open as you might have expected her to be, based on people’s descriptions of her. She is quite jumpy and keeps looking over to the garden. <br> <br> You don’t get her to talk about much, but you do manage to get her to talk about her work. She tells you that it’s not the most exciting job, but she likes meeting different people. Her work involves all sorts, like booking requests, handling complaints, stock takes- whatever is needed. Last night she assisted Mr Reyes with the new delivery of kitchen utensils. She locked them away last night, counted them all up and put them out this morning. When you ask about any knives, she assures you that they were all locked up last night as part of the stock take, and she is the only one with access to the keys<br><br> Click to minimise
