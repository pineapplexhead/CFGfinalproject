        Hazel murdered Charles with a deathly dose of Cyanide in his whiskey.
        <br><br>Opportunity:
        <br>Hazel was at Lewis’ for a movie night last night. However, he went to bed first, so 
        she was able to sneak out and deliver the whiskey to Charles.
        <br><br>Means:
        <br>She was able to access Cyanide through her girlfriend who works at a jewellers. 
        Cyanide is used in the process of plating gold and silver jewellery.
        <br><br>Motive:
        <br>Hazel knew her mum had had an affair with Charles due to Lewis’ slip up when 
        he was drunk, and after she got texts from Holly saying that Charles has a child, 
        she started to get suspicious. Hazel was Charles’ only child, and therefore would 
        inherit is fortune. And as she wants to pay for her dad’s retirement and move out
        to New York, she was very keen on getting her hands on that...
